Smart Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

📌 Project Overview

This project is a Smart Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using an ESP32 and DHT11 sensor. It continuously measures temperature and humidity and sends the data to a cloud dashboard for real-time monitoring. This system is ideal for homes, offices, greenhouses, and industrial applications.

🔧 Features

📡 Real-time Monitoring: Captures temperature and humidity data continuously.

☁️ Cloud Integration: Sends data to a cloud dashboard (e.g., ThingsBoard, Firebase, or MQTT broker).

📊 Data Visualization: Displays readings on an interactive dashboard with graphs.

🔔 Alerts & Notifications: Triggers alerts if temperature/humidity crosses a threshold.

🔋 Low Power Consumption: Efficient use of ESP32 to optimize power usage.
